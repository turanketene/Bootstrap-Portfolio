## Name: Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description: 
Bootstrap allows us to save time on creating websites because it provides us with pre-made templates and content that we can use for our websites. It also is very helpful with mobile responsiveness so it prevents further work on a css file to add media queries. In this project, a template was chosen from startbootstrap.com called "Freelancer". It is a one page theme that was used used as a template to recreate the portfolio made in week one. To do this, the index.html file was edited according to what was actually needed for the portfolio. Many unnecessary sections were deleted, and many sections were modified, including the grid system to make it look normal on the screen.

## Usage:
This project can be used to see how a bootstrap template can be used to make websites. By picking  the right theme that were interested in and modifying it according to what we need on the website, a user can save a lot of time when creating websites.
